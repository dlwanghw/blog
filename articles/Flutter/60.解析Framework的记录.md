### Widget

1. Widget的定位
```dart
/// Describes the configuration for an [Element].
```

Widget作为Element的配置对象和已知的Android的应用开发或者ios的应用开发框架是不同的，Widget更像是html+css作为配置信息而存在，浏览器渲染内核将其解析并生成dom，而elment等价于dom对象中的节点。而渲染树等价于浏览器的渲染树。

2. Widget是一个Immutable对象
```dart
abstract class Widget extends DiagnosticableTree {
  /// Initializes [key] for subclasses.
  const Widget({ this.key });
```

使用常数构造函数来构造，Immutable Widget的所有成员都应该是final的

3. 主要接口

   `创建Element`: Widget的核心作用就是用Widget中定义的配置信息来Inflate一个Element。

   `比较Widget是否一致`：使用Key的方式来判断Widget是否是同一个Widget，以便决定Widget是否要更新。





### StatelessWidget

1. StatelessWidget的定位
```dart
/// A widget that does not require mutable state.
///
/// A stateless widget is a widget that describes part of the user interface by
/// building a constellation of other widgets that describe the user interface
/// more concretely. The building process continues recursively until the
/// description of the user interface is fully concrete (e.g., consists
/// entirely of [RenderObjectWidget]s, which describe concrete [RenderObject]s).
```

StatelessWidget用来描述部分UI界面，framework会解析递归解析StatelessWidget的配置信息，直到生成element树

2. StatelessWidget是一个Immutable Widget

其所有的信息都通过自身的属性或者buildContext来获得，也就是说只要在构造函数中能够决定配置信息的，都可以使用StatelessWidget。如果在构造期间不能决定，那就只能使用StatefulWidget.
StatelessWidget的声明周期是一帧，即每一帧可能都会重建Widget。从这个角度看，StatelessWidget也是可以实现持续变化的效果的，比如它依赖一个InheritWidget，而InheritWidget的值发生了变化。
其更新的时机为：

```dart
/// The [build] method of a stateless widget is typically only called in three
/// situations: the first time the widget is inserted in the tree, when the
/// widget's parent changes its configuration, and when an [InheritedWidget] it
/// depends on changes.
```

3. 主要接口

* 确定此widget要inflate哪个Element
```dart
  @override
  StatelessElement createElement() => StatelessElement(this);
```
这样做的目的是根据Widget树中一个Widget配置信息，构建起Element树中的一个节点

* 决定Widget的样子
```dart
  @protected
  Widget build(BuildContext context);
```
这个方法的实现只能依赖两类数据：一个是构造函数决定的属性，一个是通过BuildContext携带的数据(InheritWidget的实现方法)

### StatefulWidget

1. StatefulWidget的定位

```dart
/// Stateful widgets are useful when the part of the user interface you are
/// describing can change dynamically, e.g. due to having an internal
/// clock-driven state, or depending on some system state. For compositions that
/// depend only on the configuration information in the object itself and the
/// [BuildContext] in which the widget is inflated, consider using
/// [StatelessWidget].
```
如果需要持续变化，其依赖的信息无法在BuildContext中保存信息，则需要StatefulWidget，StatefulWidget提供了setState函数用来作为更新触发时机。

/// ## Pitfalls
///
/// GlobalKeys should not be re-created on every build. They should usually be

/// on each build.

/// 3. StatelessWidget依赖的InheritedWidget发生了变更
///
/// If a widget's parent will regularly change the widget's configuration, or if
/// it depends on inherited widgets that frequently change, then it is important
/// to optimize the performance of the [build] method to maintain a fluid
/// rendering performance.
/// 试想如果每一帧都要重建所有的widget，也就是调用widget的build方法，如果widget的父widget频发变更
/// 或者widget所依赖的InheritedWidget频发变更，此时就应该优化build方法
///
/// 问题：widget的build方法是每一帧都会调用么？还是有判断会避免每次都调用？canUpdate？
/// There are several techniques one can use to minimize the impact of
/// rebuilding a stateless widget:
///
///  * Minimize the number of nodes transitively created by the build method and
///    any widgets it creates. For example, instead of an elaborate arrangement
///    of [Row]s, [Column]s, [Padding]s, and [SizedBox]es to position a single
///    child in a particularly fancy manner, consider using just an [Align] or a
///    [CustomSingleChildLayout]. Instead of an intricate layering of multiple
///    [Container]s and with [Decoration]s to draw just the right graphical
///    effect, consider a single [CustomPaint] widget.
/// 优化1: 减少widget的数量，这样就减少了widget build的调用
///  * Use `const` widgets where possible, and provide a `const` constructor for
///    the widget so that users of the widget can also do so.
/// 优化2：使用const修饰，这样会避免重建，因为const修饰的意味是在编译器决定不会发生变化
///  * Consider refactoring the stateless widget into a stateful widget so that
///    it can use some of the techniques described at [StatefulWidget], such as
///    caching common parts of subtrees and using [GlobalKey]s when changing the
///    tree structure.
///  优化3: 使用StatefulWidget代替StatelessWidget，或者使用globalKey来延长生命期
///  也就是说通常情况下，尽量使用StatelessWidget这样可以保持程序简单。但是当频繁build发生的时候
///  需要使用StatefulWidget或者globalKey的方式来改善频繁的build问题
///  。
///  * If the widget is likely to get rebuilt frequently due to the use of
///    [InheritedWidget]s, consider refactoring the stateless widget into
///    multiple widgets, with the parts of the tree that change being pushed to
///    the leaves. For example instead of building a tree with four widgets, the
///    inner-most widget depending on the [Theme], consider factoring out the
///    part of the build function that builds the inner-most widget into its own
///    widget, so that only the inner-most widget needs to be rebuilt when the
///    theme changes.
///  优化4：当widget的build 是因为InheritedWidget的频繁变更导致的，此时将widget尝试移到叶子节点
///  这样就只会调用自身的build，而不会引起其子树的全部build

/// 当有定周期的事件会触发widget的state变更，或者系统状态变更触发widget的state变化，这个时候
/// 使用StatefulWidget。
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqCMFXEmf3w}
///
/// [StatefulWidget] instances themselves are immutable and store their mutable
/// state either in separate [State] objects that are created by the
/// [createState] method, or in objects to which that [State] subscribes, for
/// example [Stream] or [ChangeNotifier] objects, to which references are stored
/// in final fields on the [StatefulWidget] itself.
///
/// StatefulWidget的状态是保存在创建的State对象或者保存在State对象 subscribe 的对象上
/// 比如Stream/ChangeNotifier对象上，这些对象的引用时保存在StatefulWidget的自身属性上的。
///
/// The framework calls [createState] whenever it inflates a
/// [StatefulWidget], which means that multiple [State] objects might be
/// associated with the same [StatefulWidget] if that widget has been inserted
/// into the tree in multiple places. Similarly, if a [StatefulWidget] is
/// removed from the tree and later inserted in to the tree again, the framework
/// will call [createState] again to create a fresh [State] object, simplifying
/// the lifecycle of [State] objects.
///
/// 当framework 创建StatefulWidget时，就会调用createState来创建state对象
/// 因为StatefulWidget也可能会多次插入到树中，所以可能会有多个State对象，State对象和Element的生命周期是一致的
///
/// A [StatefulWidget] keeps the same [State] object when moving from one
/// location in the tree to another if its creator used a [GlobalKey] for its
/// [key]. Because a widget with a [GlobalKey] can be used in at most one
/// location in the tree, a widget that uses a [GlobalKey] has at most one
/// associated element. The framework takes advantage of this property when
/// moving a widget with a global key from one location in the tree to another
/// by grafting the (unique) subtree associated with that widget from the old
/// location to the new location (instead of recreating the subtree at the new
/// location). The [State] objects associated with [StatefulWidget] are grafted
/// along with the rest of the subtree, which means the [State] object is reused
/// (instead of being recreated) in the new location. However, in order to be
/// eligible for grafting, the widget must be inserted into the new location in
/// the same animation frame in which it was removed from the old location.
///
/// ## Performance considerations
///
/// There are two primary categories of [StatefulWidget]s.
///
/// The first is one which allocates resources in [State.initState] and disposes
/// of them in [State.dispose], but which does not depend on [InheritedWidget]s
/// or call [State.setState]. Such widgets are commonly used at the root of an
/// application or page, and communicate with subwidgets via [ChangeNotifier]s,
/// [Stream]s, or other such objects. Stateful widgets following such a pattern
/// are relatively cheap (in terms of CPU and GPU cycles), because they are
/// built once then never update. They can, therefore, have somewhat complicated
/// and deep build methods.
/// 第一类StatefulWidget，是在initState 和 dispose 中申请和销毁资源，同时并没有InheritedWidget和State.setState的调用
/// StatefulWidget的变化仅仅依赖ChangeNotifier或者Steam等对象进行更新，这个时候build方法复杂点没有问题，因为
/// build仅仅会发生一次。
///
/// The second category is widgets that use [State.setState] or depend on
/// [InheritedWidget]s. These will typically rebuild many times during the
/// application's lifetime, and it is therefore important to minimize the impact
/// of rebuilding such a widget. (They may also use [State.initState] or
/// [State.didChangeDependencies] and allocate resources, but the important part
/// is that they rebuild.)
///
/// 第二类StatefulWidget，是依赖State.setState 和InheritedWidget 来触发变更的，
/// 这个时候，会引起重建，即build方法会被重新调用。
///
/// There are several techniques one can use to minimize the impact of
/// rebuilding a stateful widget:
///
///  * Push the state to the leaves. For example, if your page has a ticking
///    clock, rather than putting the state at the top of the page and
///    rebuilding the entire page each time the clock ticks, create a dedicated
///    clock widget that only updates itself.
///    将持续变化的widget移到叶子节点
///
///  * Minimize the number of nodes transitively created by the build method and
///    any widgets it creates. Ideally, a stateful widget would only create a
///    single widget, and that widget would be a [RenderObjectWidget].
///    (Obviously this isn't always practical, but the closer a widget gets to
///    this ideal, the more efficient it will be.)
///    最小化widget的数量
///
///  * If a subtree does not change, cache the widget that represents that
///    subtree and re-use it each time it can be used. It is massively more
///    efficient for a widget to be re-used than for a new (but
///    identically-configured) widget to be created. Factoring out the stateful
///    part into a widget that takes a child argument is a common way of doing
///    this.
///    将StatefulWidget重构为StatelessWidget，使用参数的方式传给StatelessWidget
///
///  * Use `const` widgets where possible. (This is equivalent to caching a
///    widget and re-using it.)
///   使用conste修饰widget的构造函数，等价于cache效果
///
///  * Avoid changing the depth of any created subtrees or changing the type of
///    any widgets in the subtree. For example, rather than returning either the
///    child or the child wrapped in an [IgnorePointer], always wrap the child
///    widget in an [IgnorePointer] and control the [IgnorePointer.ignoring]
///    property. This is because changing the depth of the subtree requires
///    rebuilding, laying out, and painting the entire subtree, whereas just
///    changing the property will require the least possible change to the
///    render tree (in the case of [IgnorePointer], for example, no layout or
///    repaint is necessary at all).
///
///    类似IgnorePointer这样的，没有layout或者paint必要的，不要在其下创建子widget，因为这样会改变widget的深度
///
///  * If the depth must be changed for some reason, consider wrapping the
///    common parts of the subtrees in widgets that have a [GlobalKey] that
///    remains consistent for the life of the stateful widget. (The
///    [KeyedSubtree] widget may be useful for this purpose if no other widget
///    can conveniently be assigned the key.)
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// This is a skeleton of a stateful widget subclass called `YellowBird`.
///
/// In this example. the [State] has no actual state. State is normally
/// represented as private member fields. Also, normally widgets have more
/// constructor arguments, each of which corresponds to a `final` property.
///
/// ```dart
/// class YellowBird extends StatefulWidget {
///   const YellowBird({ Key? key }) : super(key: key);
///
///   @override
///   State<YellowBird> createState() => _YellowBirdState();
/// }
///
/// class _YellowBirdState extends State<YellowBird> {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return Container(color: const Color(0xFFFFE306));
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// This example shows the more generic widget `Bird` which can be given a
/// color and a child, and which has some internal state with a method that
/// can be called to mutate it:
///
/// ```dart
/// class Bird extends StatefulWidget {
///   const Bird({
///     Key? key,
///     this.color = const Color(0xFFFFE306),
///     this.child,
///   }) : super(key: key);
///
///   final Color color;
///   final Widget? child;
///
///   @override
///   State<Bird> createState() => _BirdState();
/// }
///
/// class _BirdState extends State<Bird> {
///   double _size = 1.0;
///
///   void grow() {
///     setState(() { _size += 0.1; });
///   }
///
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return Container(
///       color: widget.color,
///       transform: Matrix4.diagonal3Values(_size, _size, 1.0),

/// a fresh [State] object, simplifying the lifecycle of [State] objects.
///
/// [State] objects have the following lifecycle:
///
///  * The framework creates a [State] object by calling

///  * The newly created [State] object is associated with a [BuildContext].
///    This association is permanent: the [State] object will never change its
///    [BuildContext]. However, the [BuildContext] itself can be moved around
///    the tree along with its subtree. At this point, the [State] object is

///    State是在StatefulWidget被插入Widget树时候被createState创建出来，同时和创建出来的Element建立映射关系
///    即使用Element能够访问到State，当Element在树中移动的时候，会重新mount关联的state。
///  * The framework calls [initState]. Subclasses of [State] should override
///    [initState] to perform one-time initialization that depends on the
///    [BuildContext] or the widget, which are available as the [context] and
///    [widget] properties, respectively, when the [initState] method is
///    called.
///    initState:执行一次初始化，子类在这里做所需资源的创建
///  * The framework calls [didChangeDependencies]. Subclasses of [State] should
///    override [didChangeDependencies] to perform initialization involving
///    [InheritedWidget]s. If [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType] is
///    called, the [didChangeDependencies] method will be called again if the
///    inherited widgets subsequently change or if the widget moves in the tree.
///    didChangeDependencies:在调用完成initState之后立即调用，如果BuildContext.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType
///    被调用了，didChangeDependencies也会被立即调用，确定是否依赖的信息已经改变
///  * At this point, the [State] object is fully initialized and the framework
///    might call its [build] method any number of times to obtain a
///    description of the user interface for this subtree. [State] objects can
///    spontaneously request to rebuild their subtree by callings their
///    [setState] method, which indicates that some of their internal state
///    has changed in a way that might impact the user interface in this
///    subtree.
///    当didChangeDependencies被调用后，此时接下来会调用build函数。除此之外，build还有一个
///    触发时机，就是用户主动调用setState函数，也会触发build
///  * During this time, a parent widget might rebuild and request that this
///    location in the tree update to display a new widget with the same
///    [runtimeType] and [Widget.key]. When this happens, the framework will
///    update the [widget] property to refer to the new widget and then call the
///    [didUpdateWidget] method with the previous widget as an argument. [State]
///    objects should override [didUpdateWidget] to respond to changes in their
///    associated widget (e.g., to start implicit animations). The framework
///    always calls [build] after calling [didUpdateWidget], which means any
///    calls to [setState] in [didUpdateWidget] are redundant.
///
///    在调用build之前，还会调用didUpdateWidget来判断是否是同一个widget。
///
///  * During development, if a hot reload occurs (whether initiated from the
///    command line `flutter` tool by pressing `r`, or from an IDE), the
///    [reassemble] method is called. This provides an opportunity to
///    reinitialize any data that was prepared in the [initState] method.
///  * If the subtree containing the [State] object is removed from the tree
///    (e.g., because the parent built a widget with a different [runtimeType]
///    or [Widget.key]), the framework calls the [deactivate] method. Subclasses
///    should override this method to clean up any links between this object
///    and other elements in the tree (e.g. if you have provided an ancestor
///    with a pointer to a descendant's [RenderObject]).
///
///    当StatefulWidget被从树中移除的时候，会调用StatefulWidget关联的State对象的deactivate方法
///
///  * At this point, the framework might reinsert this subtree into another
///    part of the tree. If that happens, the framework will ensure that it
///    calls [build] to give the [State] object a chance to adapt to its new
///    location in the tree. If the framework does reinsert this subtree, it
///    will do so before the end of the animation frame in which the subtree was
///    removed from the tree. For this reason, [State] objects can defer
///    releasing most resources until the framework calls their [dispose]
///    method.
///  * If the framework does not reinsert this subtree by the end of the current
///    animation frame, the framework will call [dispose], which indicates that
///    this [State] object will never build again. Subclasses should override
///    this method to release any resources retained by this object (e.g.,
///    stop any active animations).
///  * After the framework calls [dispose], the [State] object is considered
///    unmounted and the [mounted] property is false. It is an error to call

  /// this [State] object and will remain the same for the lifetime of this
  /// object. The [BuildContext] argument is provided redundantly here so that
  /// this method matches the signature for a [WidgetBuilder].
  ///
  /// ## Design discussion
  ///
  /// ### Why is the [build] method on [State], and not [StatefulWidget]?
  ///
  /// Putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method on [State] rather
  /// than putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context, State state)` method
  /// on [StatefulWidget] gives developers more flexibility when subclassing
  /// [StatefulWidget].
  ///
  /// For example, [AnimatedWidget] is a subclass of [StatefulWidget] that
  /// introduces an abstract `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method for its
  /// subclasses to implement. If [StatefulWidget] already had a [build] method
  /// that took a [State] argument, [AnimatedWidget] would be forced to provide
  /// its [State] object to subclasses even though its [State] object is an
  /// internal implementation detail of [AnimatedWidget].
  ///
  /// Conceptually, [StatelessWidget] could also be implemented as a subclass of
  /// [StatefulWidget] in a similar manner. If the [build] method were on
  /// [StatefulWidget] rather than [State], that would not be possible anymore.
  ///
  /// Putting the [build] function on [State] rather than [StatefulWidget] also
  /// helps avoid a category of bugs related to closures implicitly capturing
  /// `this`. If you defined a closure in a [build] function on a
  /// [StatefulWidget], that closure would implicitly capture `this`, which is
  /// the current widget instance, and would have the (immutable) fields of that
  /// instance in scope:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// class MyButton extends StatefulWidget {
  ///   ...
  ///   final Color color;
  ///
  ///   @override
  ///   Widget build(BuildContext context, MyButtonState state) {
  ///     ... () { print("color: $color"); } ...
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// For example, suppose the parent builds `MyButton` with `color` being blue,
  /// the `$color` in the print function refers to blue, as expected. Now,
  /// suppose the parent rebuilds `MyButton` with green. The closure created by
  /// the first build still implicitly refers to the original widget and the
  /// `$color` still prints blue even through the widget has been updated to
  /// green.
  ///
  /// In contrast, with the [build] function on the [State] object, closures
  /// created during [build] implicitly capture the [State] instance instead of
  /// the widget instance:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// class MyButtonState extends State<MyButton> {
  ///   ...
  ///   @override
  ///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///     ... () { print("color: ${widget.color}"); } ...
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Now when the parent rebuilds `MyButton` with green, the closure created by
  /// the first build still refers to [State] object, which is preserved across
  /// rebuilds, but the framework has updated that [State] object's [widget]
  /// property to refer to the new `MyButton` instance and `${widget.color}`
  /// prints green, as expected.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [StatefulWidget], which contains the discussion on performance considerations.

/// ## Implementing the `of` method

/// widget; for example, in this case it could have returned a [Color] instead
/// of the `FrogColor` widget.

/// Occasionally, the inherited widget is an implementation detail of another
/// class, and is therefore private. The `of` method in that case is typically
/// put on the public class instead. For example, [Theme] is implemented as a
/// [StatelessWidget] that builds a private inherited widget; [Theme.of] looks
/// for that inherited widget using [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType]
/// and then returns the [ThemeData].
///
/// ## Calling the `of` method
///
/// When using the `of` method, the `context` must be a descendant of the
/// [InheritedWidget], meaning it must be "below" the [InheritedWidget] in the
/// tree.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// In this example, the `context` used is the one from the [Builder], which is
/// a child of the FrogColor widget, so this works.

/// class MyPage extends StatelessWidget {

/// This class presents a set of methods that can be used from
/// [StatelessWidget.build] methods and from methods on [State] objects.
///
/// [BuildContext] objects are passed to [WidgetBuilder] functions (such as
/// [StatelessWidget.build]), and are available from the [State.context] member.
/// Some static functions (e.g. [showDialog], [Theme.of], and so forth) also
/// take build contexts so that they can act on behalf of the calling widget, or
/// obtain data specifically for the given context.
/// BuildContext会被传递给widget的build函数，也可以通过StatefulWidget的State的context get函数来获取到
/// 许多静态的函数如[showDialog], [Theme.of]等都会持有BuildContext
///
/// Each widget has its own [BuildContext], which becomes the parent of the
/// widget returned by the [StatelessWidget.build] or [State.build] function.
/// (And similarly, the parent of any children for [RenderObjectWidget]s.)
///
/// 每个Widget都有自己的BuildContext，也就是Element，最终Element会成为Widget的Parent。
/// 特别注意的是：传入给Widget build函数的BuildContext和build返回的Widget的BuildContext
/// 是不一样的
///
/// In particular, this means that within a build method, the build context of
/// the widget of the build method is not the same as the build context of the
/// widgets returned by that build method. This can lead to some tricky cases.
/// For example, [Theme.of(context)] looks for the nearest enclosing [Theme] of
/// the given build context. If a build method for a widget Q includes a [Theme]
/// within its returned widget tree, and attempts to use [Theme.of] passing its
/// own context, the build method for Q will not find that [Theme] object. It
/// will instead find whatever [Theme] was an ancestor to the widget Q. If the
/// build context for a subpart of the returned tree is needed, a [Builder]
/// widget can be used: the build context passed to the [Builder.builder]
/// callback will be that of the [Builder] itself.
///
/// For example, in the following snippet, the [ScaffoldState.showBottomSheet]
/// method is called on the [Scaffold] widget that the build method itself
/// creates. If a [Builder] had not been used, and instead the `context`
/// argument of the build method itself had been used, no [Scaffold] would have
/// been found, and the [Scaffold.of] function would have returned null.
///
/// ```dart
/// @override
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   // here, Scaffold.of(context) returns null
///   return Scaffold(
///     appBar: const AppBar(title: Text('Demo')),
///     body: Builder(
///       builder: (BuildContext context) {

///
///    Framework 使用widget的属性作为配置信息，调用widget的createElement 来创建element
///
///  * The framework calls [mount] to add the newly created element to the tree
///    at a given slot in a given parent. The [mount] method is responsible for
///    inflating any child widgets and calling [attachRenderObject] as
///    necessary to attach any associated render objects to the render tree.
///
///    Framework 调用 element的mount 函数 将新创建的 element 添加到 element树中。
///    element的mount函数负责创建widget的子widget，同时调用attachRenderObject 构建渲染树。
///
///  * At this point, the element is considered "active" and might appear on
///    screen.
///  * At some point, the parent might decide to change the widget used to
///    configure this element, for example because the parent rebuilt with new
///    state. When this happens, the framework will call [update] with the new
///    widget. The new widget will always have the same [runtimeType] and key as
///    old widget. If the parent wishes to change the [runtimeType] or key of
///    the widget at this location in the tree, it can do so by unmounting this
///    element and inflating the new widget at this location.
///    有时候，Parent想要改变widget，比如当parent使用新的state重新。，这个时候，framework就会
///    调用element的 update 函数，
///  * At some point, an ancestor might decide to remove this element (or an
///    intermediate ancestor) from the tree, which the ancestor does by calling
///    [deactivateChild] on itself. Deactivating the intermediate ancestor will
///    remove that element's render object from the render tree and add this
///    element to the [owner]'s list of inactive elements, causing the framework
///    to call [deactivate] on this element.
///  * At this point, the element is considered "inactive" and will not appear
///    on screen. An element can remain in the inactive state only until
///    the end of the current animation frame. At the end of the animation
///    frame, any elements that are still inactive will be unmounted.
///  * If the element gets reincorporated into the tree (e.g., because it or one
///    of its ancestors has a global key that is reused), the framework will
///    remove the element from the [owner]'s list of inactive elements, call
///    [activate] on the element, and reattach the element's render object to
///    the render tree. (At this point, the element is again considered "active"
///    and might appear on screen.)
///  * If the element does not get reincorporated into the tree by the end of
///    the current animation frame, the framework will call [unmount] on the
///    element.
///  * At this point, the element is considered "defunct" and will not be

/// An [Element] that uses a [RenderObjectWidget] as its configuration.
///
/// [RenderObjectElement] objects have an associated [RenderObject] widget in
/// the render tree, which handles concrete operations like laying out,
/// painting, and hit testing.
///
/// RenderObjectWidget 与 RenderObjectElement RenderObject、这三者是一一对应的关系
/// RenderObjectWidget 用来配置
/// RenderObjectElement 用来管理
/// RenderObject 用来做layout\paint\ histtest。
///
/// Contrast with [ComponentElement].
///
/// For details on the lifecycle of an element, see the discussion at [Element].
///
/// ## Writing a RenderObjectElement subclass
///
/// There are three common child models used by most [RenderObject]s:
///
/// * Leaf render objects, with no children: The [LeafRenderObjectElement] class
///   handles this case.
///
/// * A single child: The [SingleChildRenderObjectElement] class handles this
///   case.
///
/// * A linked list of children: The [MultiChildRenderObjectElement] class
///   handles this case.
///
/// Sometimes, however, a render object's child model is more complicated. Maybe
/// it has a two-dimensional array of children. Maybe it constructs children on
/// demand. Maybe it features multiple lists. In such situations, the
/// corresponding [Element] for the [Widget] that configures that [RenderObject]
/// will be a new subclass of [RenderObjectElement].
///
/// Such a subclass is responsible for managing children, specifically the
/// [Element] children of this object, and the [RenderObject] children of its
/// corresponding [RenderObject].
///
/// ### Specializing the getters
///
/// [RenderObjectElement] objects spend much of their time acting as
/// intermediaries between their [widget] and their [renderObject]. To make this
/// more tractable, most [RenderObjectElement] subclasses override these getters
/// so that they return the specific type that the element expects, e.g.:
///
/// ```dart
/// class FooElement extends RenderObjectElement {
///
///   @override
///   Foo get widget => super.widget as Foo;
///
///   @override
///   RenderFoo get renderObject => super.renderObject as RenderFoo;
///
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Slots
///
/// Each child [Element] corresponds to a [RenderObject] which should be
/// attached to this element's render object as a child.
/// 每个Element 都有一个 RenderObject 作为 child
/// 但是每个Element的child 并不一定会最终生成实际的RenderObject
/// 比如StatelessWidget 产生的StatelessElement，其child可能是任意的RenderObject
/// 但是，元素的直接子元素可能不是最终生成它们对应的实际 [RenderObject] 的元素。
/// 例如，[StatelessElement]（[StatelessWidget] 的元素）仅对应于其子元素对应的任何 [RenderObject]。
///
/// However, the immediate children of the element may not be the ones that
/// eventually produce the actual [RenderObject] that they correspond to. For
/// example a [StatelessElement] (the element of a [StatelessWidget]) simply
/// corresponds to whatever [RenderObject] its child (the element returned by
/// its [StatelessWidget.build] method) corresponds to.
///
/// 当最终生成 [RenderObject] 的后代准备将其附加到该节点的渲染对象时，
/// 它将该插槽令牌传递回该节点，并允许该节点廉价地确定将子渲染对象放置在相对于其他节点的位置
/// 在父渲染对象中。
///
/// Each child is therefore assigned a _[slot]_ token. This is an identifier whose
/// meaning is private to this [RenderObjectElement] node. When the descendant
/// that finally produces the [RenderObject] is ready to attach it to this
/// node's render object, it passes that slot token back to this node, and that
/// allows this node to cheaply identify where to put the child render object
/// relative to the others in the parent render object.
///
/// A child's [slot] is determined when the parent calls [updateChild] to
/// inflate the child (see the next section). It can be updated by calling
/// [updateSlotForChild].
///
/// ### Updating children
///
/// Early in the lifecycle of an element, the framework calls the [mount]
/// method. This method should call [updateChild] for each child, passing in
/// the widget for that child, and the slot for that child, thus obtaining a
/// list of child [Element]s.
///
/// 在Element生命周期的早期，framework调用Element的mount函数，这个函数使用newWidget和slot
/// 来更新Element的child，即updateChild函数，这样就生成了child Element的列表
///
/// Subsequently, the framework will call the [update] method. In this method,
/// the [RenderObjectElement] should call [updateChild] for each child, passing
/// in the [Element] that was obtained during [mount] or the last time [update]
/// was run (whichever happened most recently), the new [Widget], and the slot.
/// This provides the object with a new list of [Element] objects.
///
/// 随后，framework会调用update函数，在这个函数里，RenderObjectElement对每一个孩子调用updateChild
/// 同时传递从上次的mount操作返回的element，new Widget，和slot。
/// 最终更新了RenderObjectElement的所有child。
///
/// Where possible, the [update] method should attempt to map the elements from
/// the last pass to the widgets in the new pass. For example, if one of the
/// elements from the last pass was configured with a particular [Key], and one
/// of the widgets in this new pass has that same key, they should be paired up,
/// and the old element should be updated with the widget (and the slot
/// corresponding to the new widget's new position, also). The [updateChildren]
/// method may be useful in this regard.
///
/// 当oldWidget和newWidget的key都一样的时候，就直接使用newWidget来更新Element
///
/// [updateChild] should be called for children in their logical order. The
/// order can matter; for example, if two of the children use [PageStorage]'s
/// `writeState` feature in their build method (and neither has a [Widget.key]),
/// then the state written by the first will be overwritten by the second.
///
/// #### Dynamically determining the children during the build phase
///
/// The child widgets need not necessarily come from this element's widget
/// verbatim. They could be generated dynamically from a callback, or generated
/// in other more creative ways.
/// 在build阶段是有可能动态生成Element的子widget的
///
/// #### Dynamically determining the children during layout
/// 在layout阶段是有可能动态生成Element的子widget的
///
/// If the widgets are to be generated at layout time, then generating them in
/// the [mount] and [update] methods won't work: layout of this element's render
/// object hasn't started yet at that point. Instead, the [update] method can
/// mark the render object as needing layout (see
/// [RenderObject.markNeedsLayout]), and then the render object's
/// [RenderObject.performLayout] method can call back to the element to have it
/// generate the widgets and call [updateChild] accordingly.
///
/// For a render object to call an element during layout, it must use
/// [RenderObject.invokeLayoutCallback]. For an element to call [updateChild]
/// outside of its [update] method, it must use [BuildOwner.buildScope].
///
/// The framework provides many more checks in normal operation than it does
/// when doing a build during layout. For this reason, creating widgets with
/// layout-time build semantics should be done with great care.
///
/// #### Handling errors when building
///
/// If an element calls a builder function to obtain widgets for its children,
/// it may find that the build throws an exception. Such exceptions should be
/// caught and reported using [FlutterError.reportError]. If a child is needed
/// but a builder has failed in this way, an instance of [ErrorWidget] can be
/// used instead.
///
/// ### Detaching children
///
/// It is possible, when using [GlobalKey]s, for a child to be proactively
/// removed by another element before this element has been updated.
/// (Specifically, this happens when the subtree rooted at a widget with a
/// particular [GlobalKey] is being moved from this element to an element
/// processed earlier in the build phase.) When this happens, this element's
/// [forgetChild] method will be called with a reference to the affected child
/// element.
///
/// The [forgetChild] method of a [RenderObjectElement] subclass must remove the
/// child element from its child list, so that when it next [update]s its
/// children, the removed child is not considered.
///
/// For performance reasons, if there are many elements, it may be quicker to
/// track which elements were forgotten by storing them in a [Set], rather than
/// proactively mutating the local record of the child list and the identities
/// of all the slots. For example, see the implementation of
/// [MultiChildRenderObjectElement].
///
/// ### Maintaining the render object tree
///
/// Once a descendant produces a render object, it will call
/// [insertRenderObjectChild]. If the descendant's slot changes identity, it
/// will call [moveRenderObjectChild]. If a descendant goes away, it will call
/// [removeRenderObjectChild].
///
/// These three methods should update the render tree accordingly, attaching,
/// moving, and detaching the given child render object from this element's own
/// render object respectively.
///
/// ### Walking the children
///
/// If a [RenderObjectElement] object has any children [Element]s, it must
/// expose them in its implementation of the [visitChildren] method. This method
/// is used by many of the framework's internal mechanisms, and so should be
/// fast. It is also used by the test framework and [debugDumpApp].

  /// rebuilt (see [State.build]). See [State.setState] for further details on

  /// 第三步：Build阶段，所有在Element树上被标记为dirty的Element 将会被重建，调用build函数。

  /// out (see [RenderObject.performLayout]). See [RenderObject.markNeedsLayout]
  /// for further details on marking an object dirty for layout.
  /// 第四步: layout阶段， 所有的渲染树上的Dirty元素都将被Layout，执行Layout操作
  ///
  /// 5. The compositing bits phase: The compositing bits on any dirty
  /// [RenderObject] objects are updated. See
  /// [RenderObject.markNeedsCompositingBitsUpdate].
  ///
  /// 6. The paint phase: All the dirty [RenderObject]s in the system are
  /// repainted (see [RenderObject.paint]). This generates the [Layer] tree. See
  /// [RenderObject.markNeedsPaint] for further details on marking an object
  /// dirty for paint.
  /// 第六步: 描画阶段， 所有的渲染树上的dirty元素都将被重新描画。
  /// 7. The compositing phase: The layer tree is turned into a [Scene] and
  /// sent to the GPU.
  ///
  /// 8. The semantics phase: All the dirty [RenderObject]s in the system have
  /// their semantics updated (see [RenderObject.assembleSemanticsNode]). This
  /// generates the [SemanticsNode] tree. See
  /// [RenderObject.markNeedsSemanticsUpdate] for further details on marking an
  /// object dirty for semantics.
  ///
  /// For more details on steps 4-8, see [PipelineOwner].
